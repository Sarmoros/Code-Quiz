# Code-Quiz

Created a site for users to test their coding knowledge or to further practice their coding skills, by having a timed quiz with a series of multiple choice questions based on coding facts. With every wrong answer chosen, there will be a 10 second penalty. With every right answer, there are no penalties. At the end, the remaining seconds left will be your score. Compete with yourselves or others to get the highest score!
